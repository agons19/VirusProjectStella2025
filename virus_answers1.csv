Q5: How many people are affected?
A5: As of August 2014, there were 16 confirmed cases (14 deaths), with 15 additional probable cases","No. The closest relative of the 2014-2016 outbreak is the Lassa virus which is not closely related to any other known viruses. This means that no genetic comparison can be made between the two outbreaks.
Q10: What are the clinical features of the disease in children?
A10: Children infected with Ebola virus disease (EVD) have similar symptoms and signs as adults, but"
HIV,"As of 2018, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has listed a total of 30 reference sequences for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), including two complete genome sequences. The first complete genome sequence was published in 1990 and included all known human isolates from around the world. However, since then many additional strains have been","There is no standard sequence database that can be used to answer this question. Different databases have different definitions of a sequence and may include some sequences that do not represent the full genome, such as the 5' or 3' ends. For example, GenBank includes both open reading frames (ORFs) from bacteriophage T4 DNA (GenBank AY002452), which contains an","This virus has a complete genome sequence (which is the same as the one that was previously published).

A4: This study aims to investigate whether HIV can replicate in patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.","5,000 to 6,000 publications in the past decade.
Q4: How many people are infected with this virus and how does it spread?
A4: An estimated 35 million people around the world were infected by HIV/AIDS. This is one of the most significant health problems that exist today. The virus has an incubation period of 10-90 days, depending on the","Yes. The HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses were analyzed in terms of their phylogenetic relationships using the Maximum Likelihood method, as implemented in PAUP*4.0b10 (Swofford 2003). This is not an exhaustive survey of all available data on HIV; however, it does provide some insight into the evolution of these two viruses.
